# Building Your First Data Pipeline in Apache Spark

This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Building Your First Data Pipeline in Apache Spark](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/first-data-pipeline-in-spark/).

When going through the demos, import the `FirstDataPipeline.dbc` notebooks into a Databricks workspace.
